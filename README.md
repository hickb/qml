<h1>QML Framework Utilities</h1>
<p>Welcome to the QML Framework Utilities project! This project aims to provide a set of utilities for creating custom user interfaces in QML for multiple DCCs (digital content creation software).</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As a pipeline technical director, you are often responsible for integrating custom UI elements into various DCCs. This can be a time-consuming and frustrating process, as each DCC has its own unique set of tools and APIs for creating and modifying UI elements.</p>
<p>The QML Framework Utilities project aims to streamline this process by providing a set of tools and libraries that can be used to create custom UI elements in QML, a declarative language for designing user interfaces. With these utilities, you can create custom UI elements that are compatible with multiple DCCs, reducing the time and effort required to integrate your custom UI into various DCCs.</p>
