he MessageModel class represents the model and the HelloWorldViewModel class represents the view model. The MessageModel class is responsible for storing and providing data, while the HelloWorldViewModel class is responsible for exposing data and functionality to the view (QML file).

The HelloWorldViewModel class has a changeMessage signal that is emitted when the data in the model changes. 

This signal is connected to the onMessageChanged slot in the HelloWorldViewModel class.

In the QML file, the helloWorldViewModel context property is used to bind the message property of the HelloWorldViewModel class to the text of the Text element. The onClicked signal of the Button element is connected to the setMessage slot of the HelloWorldViewModel class, which allows you to change the message in the model when the button is clicked.

It is also a good practice to include a reset function in the view model, as you have done with the resetMessage slot. This allows the view to reset the data in the model to its original state.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
